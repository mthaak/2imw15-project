Columns meanings:
A: user_id: User ID of the author of the tweet (type long)
B: screen_name: User name of the author of the tweet, it's unique for every user (possible to query user information by the name)
C: tweet_id: it's not possible to use this data to retrieve new information with the twitter API because you're not allowed to
 trace tweets older than 1 week. By the way it's a useful information to discriminate tweets during data analysis. (type long)
D: created_at: Date and time of the post (type long)
E: text: Message sent by the author, sometimes you can see symbols instead of some special characters (accents, emoticons...),
 you should manage this implementing an easy method to avoid errors while reading the text
