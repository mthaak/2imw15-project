File results.csv
This file uses "tab" as columns separator.
This file is organized as follows (refer to the columns of the dataset as A, B, C, etc...):
A	    |B          |C      |D                  |E	      |F		   |G		     |H
UserID  |UserName   |TweetID|DateOfPublication  |TweetText|#ofFollowers|#ofFollowings|#ofStatuses

Columns meanings:
A: User ID of the author of the tweet, it's possible to use instead of the UserName (type long)
B: The user name of the author of the tweet, it's unique for every user (possible to query user information by the name)
C: TweetID (type long), it's not possible to use this data to retrieve new information with the twitter API because you're not allowed to trace tweets older than 1 week. By the way it's a useful information to discriminate tweets during data analysis.
D: Date and time of the post
E: Message sent by the author, sometimes you can see symbols instead of some special characters (accents, emoticons...), you should
 manage this implementing an easy method to avoid errors while reading the text
F, G, H: some information related to the author
